# Repository Guidelines

## Project Structure & Module Organization
- `src/` holds the React/TypeScript app. Entry points are `src/main.tsx` and `src/App.tsx`.
- `src/pages/` contains routed screens (for example `LoginPage.tsx`, `BingoPage.tsx`).
- `src/layouts/` wraps route groups (`AuthLayout.tsx`, `MainLayout.tsx`).
- `src/components/` is for reusable UI and route guards (for example `RequireAuth.tsx`).
- `src/assets/` and `public/` contain static assets; `dist/` is generated by builds.
- `vite.config.ts` and `pwa-assets.config.ts` define Vite, PWA, and asset generation behavior.

## Build, Test, and Development Commands
- `npm run dev`: start the Vite dev server with HMR.
- `npm run build`: type-check and build the production bundle into `dist/`.
- `npm run preview`: serve the production build locally.
- `npm run lint`: run ESLint across the codebase.

## Coding Style & Naming Conventions
- Use TypeScript + React with ESM imports. Keep JSX/TSX in `*.tsx` files.
- Indent with 2 spaces in TS/TSX; if a file uses a different style, match it locally.
- Component and page files use PascalCase (`ProfilePage.tsx`, `MainLayout.tsx`).
- Never use the `any` type. Prefer explicit types or `unknown` with narrowing.
- Keep one component per file; avoid multiple component exports in a single file.
- Write for maintainability: small components, clear props, and minimal side effects.
- Design is mobile-first and always responsive across common breakpoints.
- TailwindCSS is enabled via `@tailwindcss/vite`; prefer `className` utilities over bespoke CSS unless needed.
- Run `npm run lint` before pushing; no formatter is configured, so keep changes consistent with nearby code.

## Testing Guidelines
- No automated test runner is configured yet (there is no `npm test` script).
- If adding tests, place them near source (for example `src/components/Foo.test.tsx`) and document the runner and commands in `package.json`.

## Commit & Pull Request Guidelines
- Recent commits use short, sentence-case summaries (for example `Auto update for app`). Keep messages concise and descriptive.
- PRs should include a brief summary, testing notes, and screenshots for UI changes. Link related issues when applicable.

## PWA & Asset Notes
- PWA settings live in `vite.config.ts`; icons and generated assets are configured in `pwa-assets.config.ts`.
- Update `public/` assets when changing icons or manifest-related branding.
